# Web Scraper
Takes a website address and a number of webpages as input arguments and then goes all over the website saving every news article on the page to a separate .txt file on your computer.

Know how to send HTTP-requests and process the responses, how to work with an external library, library documentation, and how to use it for parsing the website data.
